# awe2025-Ghost-Seek
Ghost & Seek is an augmented reality game for Spectacles that transforms everyday public spaces into immersive cognitive playscapes. Designed to support **focus and attention**, the game offers **interactive challenges** and **shared experiences** that encourage players to practice attention control while strengthening social connections. By blending movement, play, and AR technology, Ghost & Seek creates an engaging environment for individuals with ADHD and those navigating cognitive recovery.



## Inspiration

Our inspiration stemmed from a desire to create a supportive, interactive tool for individuals with ADHD that bridges therapeutic strategies with real-world experiences. We were particularly drawn to the kinesthetic aspects of behavior and attention therapy—those that involve movement, space, and physical engagement. Our goal was to design an augmented reality experience that could function as a cognitive aid outside of clinical sessions, offering users a playful, non-stigmatizing way to practice focus and impulse regulation in everyday environments.

## What it does

Ghost & Seek transforms public spaces into cognitive playscapes where users engage in short AR-based attention challenges. Through guided tasks that encourage exploration, sustained focus, and present-moment awareness, the game offers a movement-based approach to practicing executive functioning skills. It is designed not as a replacement for therapy but as a complement to it—providing real-world “homework” that feels playful, empowering, and socially relevant.

## How we built it

We developed Ghost & Seek using Lens Studio for Snap Spectacles, leveraging its world-mapping capabilities and interaction framework to build spatial challenges that adapt to the user's surroundings. The project was informed by research in cognitive behavioral therapy, ADHD intervention strategies, and embodied cognition. Game mechanics were carefully designed to reflect therapeutic goals, including selective attention, impulse control, and goal-directed persistence. Iterative playtesting helped us refine the pacing, interaction design, and feedback systems to be more intuitive and inclusive.

## Challenges we ran into

A primary challenge was translating abstract therapeutic principles into engaging, spatial interactions that worked across variable environments. Ensuring that tasks felt meaningful—but not overwhelming—required multiple iterations and user feedback. On the technical side, we faced hardware-specific limitations related to UI responsiveness and AR layering on the Spectacles device. Designing for accessibility, especially for neurodiverse users, also pushed us to reevaluate our language, pacing, and visual presentation at every stage.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of creating a prototype that not only functions technically but resonates with individuals who have ADHD. The project maintains a delicate balance between clinical insight and creative expression—delivering therapeutic value in a form that is light, engaging, and movement-based. We are especially proud of our commitment to inclusive design principles and the interdisciplinary approach we took to bridge health, technology, and play.

## What we learned

This project reinforced the importance of designing for real-world use and adaptability—particularly for neurodiverse users, who often encounter rigid systems and stigmatizing experiences. We learned that cognitive design must extend beyond function to include tone, accessibility, and emotional comfort. Technically, we deepened our understanding of AR’s constraints and possibilities, especially in relation to wearable platforms and context-aware interaction.

## What's next for Ghost & Seek

We plan to expand Ghost & Seek through further user testing and clinical partnerships to better understand its impact on behavior and focus. Our next goals include refining the challenge system with adaptive difficulty, adding multiplayer elements to support social play, and exploring additional AR platforms beyond Spectacles. Ultimately, we envision Ghost & Seek as a scalable toolkit for educators, therapists, and families seeking meaningful, embodied support for attention development in everyday life.
## How to play 

The game begins by spawning virtual objects on surfaces throughout the player’s environment. Players must stay focused and actively scan the augmented physical space, keeping their attention sharp. When the ghost appears, they’ll need to spot it quickly and use a hand-tracking pinch gesture to catch it before it vanishes.
